# ROS Switch Documentation

Welcome on the ROS Switch documentation! You will find here all references on how to install, use, configure and contribute to this application.

## What is this project about ?

As a student, I was working on several ROS projects at the same time. And honestly, it's tiring to modify my .bashrc every time I need a new configuration, and launch the function everytime I open a new terminal. So why not have a program that would take simple YAML configuration, generate automatically these bash script and let me switch from one environment to another easily ?

That's what this project is about: 

- simplifying the ROS environment configuration through a simple YAML file that can be easily shared, 
- provide tools to switch between custom environment with a proper cleaning of pathes and environment variables.

This project was heavily inspired from the [ros_management_tools](https://github.com/oKermorgant/ros_management_tools/) project from the professor O. Kermorgant from the LS2N (*laboratory on the Centrale Nantes campus, France*), who made a simple bash script for switching between the several ROS environments needed for the labs.
