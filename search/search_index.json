And honestly, it's tiring to modify my .bashrc every time I need a new configuration, and launch the function everytime I open a new terminal. So why not have a program that would take simple YAML configuration, generate automatically these bash script and let me switch from one environment to another easily ?</p> <p>That's what this project is about: </p> <ul> <li>simplifying the ROS environment configuration through a simple YAML file that can be easily shared, </li> <li>provide tools to switch between custom environment with a proper cleaning of pathes and environment variables.</li> </ul> <p>This project was heavily inspired from the ros_management_tools project from the professor O. Kermorgant from Centrale Nantes, who made a simple bash script for switching between the several ROS environments needed for the labs.</p> <p>     Distributed under the MIT Licence - \u00a9 Meltwin 2024 </p>"},{"location":"install/","title":"Install from source (Linux)","text":""},{"location":"install/#get-the-sources","title":"Get the sources","text":"<p>You can either download the latest release, or clone the repository to you machine.</p>"},{"location":"install/#downloading-the-latest-release","title":"Downloading the latest release","text":"<p>The latest release can be found on this link: ROS Switch - Release page.
